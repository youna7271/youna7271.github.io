     <div class="blurb q4">
      <p class="ques">Nearly nine years ago, on Sept. 9, 2009, nine couples tied the knot on aisle 9 at a local 99 Cents Only Store in Hollywood â€“ for a mere 99 cents per couple. To commemorate #99Day (September 9), three of the couples will be returning to where it all began and celebrate their ninth wedding anniversary by renewing their wedding vows in that same store and aisle.</p>
